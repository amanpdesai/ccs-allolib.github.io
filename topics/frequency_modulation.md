Frequency Modulation is a technique introduced by Jown Chowning.

This book helps to understand it:

"FM Theory and Applications: By Musicians for Musicians"

# FM Recipes from Chowning (via Sabina Hyojun Ahn's notes for MUS109IA/MUS276IA F23):

```
I. BRASS
1) attack =.1, decay =.1, sus =.8,idx1=0 ,idx2=5,idx3=5, carMul=1, modMul =1.0007
2) attack =.1, decay =.4, sus =.8, idx1=0, idx2=5, idx3=3, carMul =1, modMul =1.0009

________________________________________________________________
II. WOODWIND
Clarinet
1) attack =.1, decay =.1, sus =.8, idx1=0 , idx2=2.0, idx3=2.0, carMul =3, modMul =2.0007
Oboe
1) attack =.1, decay =.1, sus =.8, idx1=0 , idx2=2.0, idx3=2.0, carMul =3, modMul =1.0007
1.5
3 2
Basson
1) attack =.1, decay =.1, sus =.8, idx1=0 , idx2=1.5, idx3=1.5, carMul =5, modMul =1.0007

III. GONG SOUND
(shortest duration about 3 seconds)
1) attack =.001, decay =most of note dur, sus =.95, idx1=5, idx2=4, idx3=4, carMul =1,
modMul =1.4
2) Same as 1 except p17=1.45 and idx1=4.0
3) Same as 1 except p17=1.48 and idx1=6.0
4) Same as 1 except p17=1.35 and idx1=8.0
5) Same as 1 except p17=1.4 and idx1=.5

IV. DRUM-LIKE SOUNDS
(overall duration try approx .3sec)
1) attack =.001, decay =most of note dur, sus =.95, idx1=3, idx2=2, idx3=2, carMul =1,
modMul =1.4
